# Hydravisor – Technical Design Document

**Version:** 0.1.0

## 🎯 Purpose

This document outlines the architecture, dependencies, module interactions, and verification criteria for Hydravisor: a TUI-based virtualization and AI model management tool written in Rust.

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

Hydravisor is composed of:

* A Ratatui-based TUI frontend
* A backend manager orchestrating KVM and containerd
* Model adapters for Ollama (local) and Amazon Bedrock (remote)
* Integrated `tmux` session handler for shared user/AI environments

## 📦 Crate Decisions

| Crate                         | Purpose                          | Reason for Selection                                                    |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ratatui`                     | Terminal UI rendering            | Most actively developed, expressive TUI crate in the Rust ecosystem     |
| `clap`                        | CLI parsing                      | Standard for Rust CLI apps, excellent UX and auto-docs                  |
| `serde`                       | Serialization/deserialization    | Best supported, ubiquitous in Rust; integrates with most formats        |
| `tokio`                       | Async runtime                    | Required for Bedrock, containerd, and possible WebSocket integrations   |
| `libvirt`                     | KVM backend via libvirt bindings | Proven system interface for VM management                               |
| `containerd-client`           | gRPC interface to containerd     | Direct access to container lifecycle operations                         |
| `tmux_interface`              | tmux control and interaction     | Stable Rust interface to programmatically manage tmux sessions          |
| `ollama-rs` (or CLI wrappers) | Local model management           | Preferred for embedding LLMs like LLaMA locally                         |
| `aws-sdk-bedrock`             | Bedrock model management         | Official AWS SDK, ensures long-term support and secure API interactions |

## 🧭 Core Workflows & State Diagrams

### 1. **Launch VM with Agent**

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Idle
    Idle --> CreateVMForm: 'n' key
    CreateVMForm --> Provisioning
    Provisioning --> LaunchTmuxSession
    LaunchTmuxSession --> SharedWorkspace
    SharedWorkspace --> [*]
```

### 2. **Launch Container with Model**

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Idle
    Idle --> CreateContainerForm: 'n' key
    CreateContainerForm --> PullImage
    PullImage --> StartContainer
    StartContainer --> AttachModel
    AttachModel --> TmuxSession
    TmuxSession --> [*]
```

### 3. **Attach Model to Running Session**

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> AttachMenu
    AttachMenu --> SelectSource
    SelectSource --> InitModelSession
    InitModelSession --> TmuxDialogPane
    TmuxDialogPane --> [*]
```

## 🎛️ Command vs. Interactive Mode

Hydravisor must not interfere with existing user-defined tmux or terminal keybindings.

### Design Goals

* Separate command mode from application-interactive mode
* Maintain native tmux and editor workflows
* Offer intuitive and configurable modifier key setup

### Initial Behavior: Dedicated Session Mode (MVP)

* Hydravisor runs in its own `tmux` window or session
* All keybindings are local to the Hydravisor window
* External commands must be issued from within the application pane

### Future Enhancement: Modal Mode (Optional)

* Activated via a double-prefix approach: `C-b` → `C-9` → `{hydravisor-command}`
* Avoids using `h`, which is often reserved for `help`
* Proposed rationale: 9 = one less than 10 (Hydravisor has 10 letters); also easy to reach
* Configurable in `~/.config/hydravisor/config.toml`

```toml
[interface]
mode = "session"     # Options: "session" or "modal"
modal_key = "9"
```

| Date       | Decision                                                         | Rationale                                                                  |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2025-05-29 | Use dedicated session for MVP, modal interface as future feature | Simpler input model, easier to implement and test                          |
| 2025-05-29 | Avoid use of `h` key in modal shortcut                           | Conventionally associated with `help`; conflicts with common muscle memory |
| 2025-05-29 | Adopt `C-b` → `C-9` as modal entrypoint                          | Uncommon binding, mnemonic for '9 of 10 letters', ergonomic in tmux users  |

## 🎥 Tmux Session Recording & Archiving

### Objective

Record terminal interaction sessions, preserving both user and model behavior. These logs can be replayed, exported, or analyzed for audit and learning purposes.

### Implementation Strategy

* Use `tmux`'s `capture-pane` and `save-buffer` commands.
* Trigger recordings automatically on instance launch or by user toggle.
* Session metadata includes:

  * Instance ID or name
  * Timestamp (start/end)
  * Associated model and user role
  * Terminal log (plaintext or JSON structured)

### Replay Options

* Use `tmux` buffer restoration
* Stream log into a playback shell view
* Export as ANSI-correct `.cast` (e.g., for Asciinema compatibility)

### Archive Format

* Directory per session:

  ```text
  ~/.hydravisor/logs/
  └── session-2025-05-29T20:15:42Z/
      ├── meta.json
      ├── terminal.log
      └── dialog.jsonl
  ```

### Functional Tests

| Scenario                          | Expectation                                   |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| VM with tmux recording enabled    | Log file exists after shutdown                |
| Mid-session user-initiated save   | Buffer saved and available via CLI export     |
| Model messages recorded correctly | Model dialog separated into structured format |
