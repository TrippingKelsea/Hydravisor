# Hydravisor Roadmap

## Project Vision

Hydravisor aims to become a tool for secure, auditable AI agent sandbox management. The goal is to enable safe AI agent development and deployment by providing comprehensive isolation, monitoring, and policy enforcement capabilities. In essence allowing you to bring whatever agent framework you're working with, and run it in a completely sandboxed environment locally from your terminal in a quickly deployable and destroyable fashion.
